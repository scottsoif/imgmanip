Design Using C++ Final Project

## Project structure

### Dependencies

Install future dependencies into the `lib` folder. Currently, there is only `armidillo` for linear algebra.

You will need to run `./install.sh` to finish setting up these dependencies. ENSURE YOU HAVE NO WHITESPACE IN YOUR DIRECTORY PATH.

### Makefile

For future tests, write additional make entry in Makefile.

### imgmanip

Each subdirectory in `imgmanip` is a "module." Remember to update Makefile when you add a new "module."

### tests

Contains test executable.
